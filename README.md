ML model to predict Breast Cancer

In this repository you find two notebooks.

One of the notebooks contains a ML to predict Breast Cancer with only 3 variables, and the other is the same with 5 variables.

The two models basicallya are the same, without the only difference one use 3 variables and the other use 5, because that i only write comments only in the first model (3 var).
